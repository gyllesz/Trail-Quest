12:30 - START
•	Going through the assessment requirements for iteration 2
•	Emphasised the importance of generalized for reusability (certain forms can reuse code)
•	Utilize pomodoro for effective working
12:50 
•	Finish review of assignment requirements, everyone knows what they are doing and how to do it
•	Using Jira, differentiated user stories and assigned them to members.
•	Identified common functions for validations between the user forms.
•	12 functions for 6 forms

1:00 – RETROSPECTIVE 
•	Go through retrospective to improve iteration
•	1. Continue the use of github for iteration 2 since it was the most effective tool from iteration 1 and essentially form of communication
•	2. This time around is already an improvement since our last obstacle was lack of communication and we are currently in a face to face meeting.
•	3. Expected to hit our targets earlier this time.
•	4. For this sprint we are implementing more consistent meetings.
•	5. Implementing use of Jira for top down visualization of project progress.
•	6. Earlier start-time to address quality compromise from last iteration.
•	7. Treating this task with more urgency and importance, not getting overconfident and cocky for the tasks this time around. Problems that arise with this iteration can be solved in a more thorough and timely manner.
•	8. The use of Jira this implementation will allow us to track progress better. 
•	9. Jira helps with project decomposition and task delegation which will allow us to manage time and resources better this time around. 
•	10. Revisit client feedback from iteration 1 to improve system design and layout. 
•	NOTE FOR 3RD ITERATION – Record meetings earlier. 
•	Pomodoro break

1:15 – DESIGN PHASE 
•	Modern website designers work from phone display first and then optimize for desktop users.
•	Case studies:
o	Threads
- Layouts
o	Facebook
o	Gumtree
•	Design ideas
o	Centre carousel for trail showcase
•	Concluded that most system designs follow a layout respective of their design type. Eg: 
o	Social media layout prioritized for phone scrolling for browsing 
o	Market place layouts

1:50 – IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 
•	Members choose tasks and start
•	Issue joining Jira project
